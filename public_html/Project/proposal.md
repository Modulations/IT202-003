- Milestone 4
  - User can set their profile to be public or private (will need another column in Users table)
    - If public, hide email address from other users
  - User will be able open a savings account
    - System will generate a 12 digit/character account number per the existing rules (see Checking Account above)
    - System will associate the account to the user
    - Account type will be set as savings
    - Will require a minimum deposit of $5 (from the world account)
      - Entry will be recorded in the Transaction table in a transaction pair (per notes below)
      - Account Balance will be updated based on SUM of BalanceChange of AccountSrc
    - System sets an APY that’ll be used to calculate monthly interest based on the balance of the account
      - Recommended to create a table for “system properties” and have this value stored there and fetched when needed, this will allow you to have an admin account change the value in the future)
    - User will see user-friendly error messages when appropriate
    - User will see user-friendly success message when account is created successfully
      - Redirect user to their Accounts page
  - User will be able to take out a loan
    - System will generate a 12 digit/character account number per the existing rules (see Checking Account above)
    - Account type will be set as loan
    - Will require a minimum value of $500
    - System will show an APY (before the user submits the form)
      - This will be used to add interest to the loan account
      - Recommended to create a table for “system properties” and have this value stored there and fetched when needed, this will allow you to have an admin account change the value in the future)
    - Form will have a dropdown of the user’s accounts of which to deposit the money into
    - Special Case for Loans:
      - Loans will show with a positive balance of what’s required to pay off (although it is a negative since the user owes it)
    - User will transfer funds to the loan account to pay it off
    - Transfers will continue to be recorded in the Transactions table
    - Loan account’s balance will be the balance minus any transfers to this account
    - Interest will be applied to the current loan balance and add to it (causing the user to owe more)
    - A loan with 0 balance will be considered paid off and will not accrue interest and will be eligible to be marked as closed
    - User can’t transfer more money from a loan once it’s been opened and a loan account should not appear in the Account Source dropdowns
  - User will see user-friendly error messages when appropriate
  - User will see user-friendly success message when account is created successfully
    - Redirect user to their Accounts page
  - Listing accounts and/or viewing Account Details should show any applicable APY or “-” if none is set for the particular account (may alternatively just hide the display for these types)
  - User will be able to close an account
    - User must transfer or withdraw all funds out of the account before doing so
    - Account should have a column “active” that will get set as false.
      - All queries for Accounts should be updated to pull only “active” = true accounts (i.e., dropdowns, My Accounts, etc)
      - Do not delete the record, this is a soft delete so it doesn’t break transactions
    - Closed accounts don’t show up anymore
    - If the account is a loan, it must be paid off in full first
  - Admin role (leave this section for last)
    - Will be able to search for users by firstname and/or lastname
    - Will be able to look-up specific account numbers (partial match).
    - Will be able to see the transaction history of an account
    - Will be able to freeze an account (this is similar to disable/delete but it’s a different column)
      - Frozen accounts still show in results, but they can’t be interacted with.
      - [Dev note]: Will want to add a column to Accounts table called frozen and default it to false
        - Update transactions logic to not allow frozen accounts to be used for a transaction
    - Will be able to open accounts for specific users
    - Will be able to deactivate a user
      - Requires a new column on the Users table (i.e., is_active)
      - Deactivated users will be restricted from logging in
        - “Sorry your account is no longer active”


### Intructions
#### Don't delete this
1. Pick one project type
2. Create a proposal.md file in the root of your project directory of your GitHub repository
3. Copy the contents of the Google Doc into this readme file
4. Convert the list items to markdown checkboxes (apply any other markdown for organizational purposes)
5. Create a new Project Board on GitHub
   - Choose the Automated Kanban Board Template
   - For each major line item (or sub line item if applicable) create a GitHub issue
   - The title should be the line item text
   - The first comment should be the acceptance criteria (i.e., what you need to accomplish for it to be "complete")
   - Leave these in "to do" status until you start working on them
   - Assign each issue to your Project Board (the right-side panel)
   - Assign each issue to yourself (the right-side panel)
6. As you work
  1. As you work on features, create separate branches for the code in the style of Feature-ShortDescription (using the Milestone branch as the source)
  2. Add, commit, push the related file changes to this branch
  3. Add evidence to the PR (Feat to Milestone) conversation view comments showing the feature being implemented
     - Screenshot(s) of the site view (make sure they clearly show the feature)
     - Screenshot of the database data if applicable
     - Describe each screenshot to specify exactly what's being shown
     - A code snippet screenshot or reference via GitHub markdown may be used as an alternative for evidence that can't be captured on the screen
  4. Update the checklist of the proposal.md file for each feature this is completing (ideally should be 1 branch/pull request per feature, but some cases may have multiple)
    - Basically add an x to the checkbox markdown along with a date after
      - (i.e.,   - [x] (mm/dd/yy) ....) See Template above
    - Add the pull request link as a new indented line for each line item being completed
    - Attach any related issue items on the right-side panel
  5. Merge the Feature Branch into your Milestone branch (this should close the pull request and the attached issues)
    - Merge the Milestone branch into dev, then dev into prod as needed
    - Last two steps are mostly for getting it to prod for delivery of the assignment 
  7. If the attached issues don't close wait until the next step
  8. Merge the updated dev branch into your production branch via a pull request
  9. Close any related issues that didn't auto close
    - You can edit the dropdown on the issue or drag/drop it to the proper column on the project board
